Freshdesk has made some updates to their REST API.

- [ ] [Global pagination](https://developer.freshdesk.com/api/#pagination)
  - Works on endpoints that return a list of objects.
    - List All Tickets
    - List All Contacts
  - [ ] Per Page: `https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/contacts?per_page=<NUMBER:1 to 100>`
  - [ ] Page: `https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/contacts?page=<NUMBER>`
  - The way this library was structured, it may need to simply be added per API endpoint that supports this...
  - [ ] Identify existing endpoints that support this feature.
- [ ] [List All Tickets](https://developer.freshdesk.com/api/#list_all_tickets)
  - [ ] **Filters** were directly attached to this endpoint, in comparison to the filter endpoint that uses a special query.
    - [ ] Predefined filters
      - /api/v2/tickets?filter=[filter_name]
      - The various filters available are new_and_my_open, watching, spam, deleted.
    - [ ] Requester	/api/v2/tickets?requester_id=[id]
      - /api/v2/tickets?email=[requester_email]
